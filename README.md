# AI Trading & Quants Research 

This repository contains the code of a series of steps involved and projects in AI Trading which I completed as part of my Udacity.com course in AI for Trading. Moreover there are links to resources that can be useful for quants students learning. If you have some good references which may be of interest please send me a pull request and I will integrate them in the README.
